## News

* As you know, since July 1st 2023 I am the new Data Editor of the RES Journals.

* Big thanks 🙏 to Joan Llull for all the help during the transition.

::: fragment
### Agenda

1. Harmonization of EJ and EctJ Policies and Replication Check Processes.
2. Proposal to change proceedure of package submissions.
3. Annual report with preformance statistics.

## Proposing a Unique Data Policy for EJ and EctJ

* I don't see any pressing need for different policies.
* Unique policy would greatly help streamlining the processes.
* I would propose to take the `EJ` policy as a template and copy to `EctJ`.
* Both should be strictly aligned to the [https://datacodestandard.org](Data And Code Standard) - as is the case for EJ now.
* Me and Brooke are working on a unified processes of handling packages across both journals - this is mostly process optimization.

## Proposal for new Package Submissions

::: {.callout-note}

# Editorial Express (EE) has its limits

1. Increasingly have issues with too large packages (> 100MB) on EE.
2. Increasingly end up having to invite submissions via online fileshare systems.

:::

::: fragment

* I propose to move package submission to dropbox file request link, where authors can upload packages.
* _Conditional acceptance_ template of managing editors would contain instructions **and** would copy `ejdataeditor@gmail.com`, so I can send the file request link.
* I propose to handle all communications via `ejdataeditor@gmail.com` instead of EE. Will log histories on EE.
