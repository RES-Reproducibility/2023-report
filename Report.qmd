## Agenda

1. Process Optimization: EJ ü§ù EctJ
2. Challenges: Computing Power (Where to Stop)
3. Performance Report


## 1. Process Optimization

1. Together with Brooke and Jaap Abbring (ME of EctJ) we worked to harmonize data policies of EJ and EctJ.
2. Same London based team handles both journals now, so streamlining processes is beneficial.
3. We have almost identical data policies now.

## Challenges: Computing Power 

### Nuvolos Subscription

::: {.incremental}
* We paid 2100 Euros for a [nuvolos](https://nuvolos.cloud/) subscription in June 2023 (term until June 2024).
* 69120 CPU hours (single vCPU) in total. We've spent 48911 so far, i.e. 70%. üëç
* We need a slightly larger subscription next year, particularly large file storage.
* The service is excellent value for money.

# Where To Stop?

Applications, particularly those relying on machine learning methods, require vast computing power. Does it make sense to attempt full reproducibility checks?

## Challenges: Computing Power 

### Nuvolos NCU Usage

### Budgeting

::: {.incremental}
* Running Reproducibility Checks in-house (running them _anywhere_) costs money.
* Labor costs and costs of computing power üìà.
* (Costs of Licenses?)
* I suggest thinking about a slightly larger budget to cover those costs.
* I *strongly* suggest to renew the nuvolos subscription.

## Processing Times

x = read_list()
```

<br>

* Stayed below 15 day mark.
* Right direction üìâ.
* Graph shows cumulative times.

## Revisions Per Paper

::: {.column width="65%"}

<br>

* 80% of papers fail in first round.
* Hazard still 50% in second round.

* Replication times per paper falling.
* Resubmission times increasing.
* Graph shows cumulative times.

## Hours Spent per Iteration

* As before we pay replicators by the hour.
* on average 1h per iteration, 2 iterations per paper üëâ 2h per paper.

## Data Availability 


::: {.column width="65%"}

:::


::: {.column width="30%"}
* Confidential (üëâ for us: *complicated*) Data is on the rise.
* Temporary Access is a good solution for us.
* Partial and temp. only are the exception.
* We changed policy slightly to encourage temp access.
